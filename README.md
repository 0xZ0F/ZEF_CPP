# ZEF - WIP
### This project is in development and is not ready for use.
## In the process of being rewritten in C++.
This is a side project I'm working on. I'm building it to aid me in my software reversing and exploitation adventures. Constantly re-writing a bunch of C++ code has gotten tedious, so I'm trying to find a solution. Hopefully this is it.

The code is written in C#. It imports and implements various components from the Windows API manuallly which aren't available in C#.

Huge thanks to [PInvoke.net](http://pinvoke.net/index.aspx) for some of the definitions.
